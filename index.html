    <h3 class="question">What is MVC?</h3>
    <p class="answer">MVC is short for Model, View, Controller, an architural paradigm used in many languages to organize files for a website's backend. Look below for some specifics!</p>
    <h3 class="question">So, what is the Model in MVC?</h3>
    <p class="answer">Model refers to any code pertaining to the database portion of a websites request. Any changes, updates, general requests, all that code is placed in the Model file. The model, or database, only speaks to the controller.</p>
    <h3 class="question">So, what is the View in MVC?</h3>
    <p class="answer">View refers to anything that the client will see, basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript, as well as images. This file will talk to the controller, or directly to the client, depending onthe language.</p>
    <h3 class="question">So, what is the Controller in MVC?</h3>
    <p class="answer">Controller refers to the middleman of the files, it connects the client/router to the database/model and to the view. Through the controller is the only way for the client and view to access the Model or database.</p>
